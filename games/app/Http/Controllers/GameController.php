The attackers gained access to SolarWinds\' build system and inserted malware (SUNBURST) into Orion software updates that were distributed to thousands of customers between March and June 2020.</p><p>When organizations installed these legitimate-seeming updates, they unknowingly installed a backdoor that allowed the attackers to access their systems. The attack was particularly sophisticated, using advanced evasion techniques and carefully targeting specific high-value victims for additional exploitation.</p>',

Also affected were major companies like Microsoft, Cisco, and FireEye (which first discovered the breach).</p><p>The attack gave the perpetrators access to sensitive government and corporate networks for up to nine months before discovery. The full extent of data exfiltration may never be known, but the breach is considered one of the most significant cyber espionage campaigns ever conducted against the United States.</p>',
